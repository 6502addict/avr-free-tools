# avr-free-tools

fed up of microchip practice to force to buy new version of their programmers and obsoleting the previous version
and of their hellish mplab always bringing complexity and bugs.. I decided to prepare a set of demo project
to serve as base for other projects

these project are setting the environment to develop for:
avr tiny in assembly language (some avr tiny are really small in ressources)
         I choose avra for the compatibility with the original atmel assembler

avr mega in assembly language (for compatibility with old avr assembler project)
         I choose avra for the compatibility with the original atmel assembler 

         in pure C  using gcc-avr

         in a mix C / assembler to show the integration of c and assembler
         not that for this project I'm force to use the gnu assembler

there are also a few .md files explaining how to use these templates

according to what I've read avrdude is compatible with old atmel programmers...

in you find bugs in this project send me an email to didier@aida.org  I'll correct it
