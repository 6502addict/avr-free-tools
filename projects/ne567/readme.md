in the past  I had do use a ne567 (frequency detector) in a project
I was wondering if it could be done with an avr

the signal is input on PD6/ICP1
if the frequency is recognized the led is on (PB13)

this project can probably adapted to avr tiny by using the 
uart_tiny library found in avr-tiny-c-echo
